Problem Solving - state what you want to do first. What's supposed to happen?
- do something until something happens --> while loop
- do something for each of these things --> for loop

- something has something else --> declare board within player (battleship) 
- something is something else --> inheritance.

-ex: TicTacToe
 - in main.py --> 2 function cals that create the game & play the game
	- battleship should look similar 

Battleship 
- player should place the ships on the board for ALL the ships 


# place ships 
# for each ship we have, place that ship

Def place_ships(...):
	for ship in self.ships: 
		self.place(ship)

Def place_ship(...): 
	while True:
		try: 
			ship_placement = self.get_ship_placement()
			self.board.add_ship(ship_placement)
			return
		except:
			... #yell at player
	

*you can create study groups just don't look at any code

Back to INHERITANCE

- Method resolution order: established starting at first class & all the way up its inheritance hierarchy before going to the next class
- cooperative multi-inheritance..complicated so must know you will be doing this beforehand
